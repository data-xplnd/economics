# US Economics

### Development work is ongoing and information in this readme will continue to be updated ###

Looking into U.S. economic trends in prices and wages, employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and foreign exchange markets and how they may correlate to one another. Scripts in this repository will be used to load into an Amazon RDS Database and then visualized in Tableau (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryann.green3508)

This project will work in three visible phases:
1. Identify which economic metric I want to capture
2. Identify the datasource for each metric
3. Create Python scripts to pull data and load into Amazon RDS Database
4. Analyze data in MySQL Workbench and Tableau to find correlations, trends, and common practices of the U.S. Economy during different time periods

Data Includes:
* Average Interest Rates on U.S. Treasury Securities
* Dailly Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates
* Monthly Treasury Statements
* Consumer Price Index
* Personal Consumption Expenditures
